The topic of the project is a 3D representation of a room in which my animals are shown. 
In the scene there are Luna, my cat, Cannella, my mouse and Adi, my fish. All the animals displayed are animated. 
The user can interact with the cat using the mouse moving around a toy which Luna will follow. The others instead performs fixed animations moving in their space.
